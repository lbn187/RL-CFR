Heads-up No-limit Texas Holdâ€™em (HUNL) poker solver

Any scenario in HUNL can be solved, including preflop, flop, turn, and river, with an average solving time of less than 1 second.

Over 60 mbb/h win-rate improvement by choosing better action abstractions.

The public code is a simplified version of HUNL, where 43 public cards are dealt at the start of the game, with chip depths ranging from 5BB to 200BB, and then two players are dealt 2 private hands each, and the two players bet like in the preflop phase of HUNL, and at the end of the preflop the remaining 5 public cards are dealt out directly to the two players, and the two players compete to determine the winner.
